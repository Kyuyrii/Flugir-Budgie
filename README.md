# Flugir Budgie

Flugir-Budgie is a theme for the Budgie desktop, based on the Qogir theme.

But the project currently has the idea of ​​including other themes, so that they can be used in Snap applications without having to go through bureaucracy.

If you want to install version 2.2 via terminal, use the command below, I recommend restarting the system after the installation is complete.

``` wget https://github.com/Kyuyrii/Flugir-Budgie/releases/download/Flugir-Budgie-2.2/WFB-2.2.tar.xz && tar -xf WFB-2.2.tar.xz && ./FBF-2.2/IFB.sh ```

To use it in Snap applications, you need to install the Snap version of the theme.
